#summary The Open 18 database schema
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

Open 18 is a golf course application and golf community site. The initial database schema only includes the golf course directory tables and data.

== Business domain ==

This section discusses the business domain of the schema.

=== Open 18 directory ===

*facility:* The directory consists of golf course data. The top level entity is the facility. A facility is a conglomerate of golf courses and represents the physical location of those courses. A golf facility can have multiple courses, but more times than not there is only a single course.

*course:* The course is where you play the game of golf. The course consists of either 9 or 18 holes (though there are exceptions). 

*hole:* These holes are played in succession. At each hole there are a set of tee boxes from where the golfer starts.

*tee set:* Each tee box is represented by a color. The set of tees for a particular color spans the number of holes on the course. Once you select a tee box color, you stick with it throughout the round.

*tee:* A tee is the starting point for a particular tee set on a single hole.

== ER Diagrams ==
