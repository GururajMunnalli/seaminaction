  * *Why is the @DataModelSelection property annotated with @Out and not @In? (golftips example)*

  The @DataModelSelection is a variation of the @In annotation. The @Out annotation turns around and pushes the selected item injected by @DataModelSelection back out into a context as a top-level variable. Without @Out, the selection would only be available while the method is executing.

  * *I get an error when using @RequestParameter on a field with a primitive type. Why?*

  The @RequestParameter annotation does not require a value by default (in fact, there isn't even a setting). If the request parameter is missing, Seam will attempt to assign a null value to the field. If the field is a primitive type, Seam will be unable to perform the assignment in this case and, as a result, an error will be thrown.

  Therefore, if the field you are adding the @RequestParameter annotation to is a primitive type (e.g. int), change the field type to a primitive wrapper class (e.g. Integer). You will then have to be prepared for a null value, but that you can handle in your business logic.

  * *When do I use @Remove and @Destroy on a SFSB?*

  In Seam 2, if you have exactly one @Remove method, it's automatically made the @Destroy method. If you have multiple @Remove methods, you need @Destroy. Also @Remove @Destroy methods must have no parameters.
