== JBoss Tools Pageflow editor ==

The TIP on page 314 recommends using the Seam pageflow editor from JBoss Tools to edit your pageflow definition in a visual manner. As an additional hint, be sure to enable the Properties view in Eclipse. From that view, you can customize each node and transition w/ a rich client form. Select Window > Show View > Other... > Properties (General). Then click on either a node box or a transition line and you will see all the possible properties that you can edit for the element. It's an alternative to using Ctrl+Space tag completion in the source view.

== Using a seam-gen project in JBoss Tools ==

When the book was being written, JBoss Tools was under heavy development. Since that time it has become a very mature development environment. My instructions in chapter 2 covering how to import a seam-gen project into Eclipse are supplemented by a blog entry I wrote about [http://in.relation.to/Bloggers/UsingASeamgenProjectInJBossTools using a seam-gen project in JBoss Tools].

Pay attention to the note about refreshing the project after the import so that Eclipse picks up the files generated by the Ant build.
