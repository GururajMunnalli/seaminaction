= Introduction =

In order to use the HTTPS sheme in Seam, you have to first enable JBoss AS to accept HTTP connections over SSL. This page describes the necessary steps using a self-signed certificate.

Enable SSL on JBoss

In this example Iâ€™m only using a self-signed certificate, but the procedure would be more or less the same even if you are going to use a certificate from a Certification Authority.

  # Generate the keystore using the command below. Just make up stuff for the responses, but remember the password you provide. Also, use the same password for the keystore and the key. 
{{{
keytool -genkey -alias jbossas -keyalg RSA -keystore NAME_OF_KEYSTORE -validity NUMBER_OF_DAYS
}}}
  # Copy the generated file the conf directory of the JBoss AS default domain (or the one you are using):
{{{
cp jbossas ${jboss.home}/server/default/conf/jbossas.keystore
}}}
  # Open the file ${jboss.home}/server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/server.xml in your editor, remove the XML comment around the SSL-connector, and modify the attributes to match the configuration shown here: 
{{{
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
           maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
           clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
           keystoreFile="${jboss.server.home.dir}/conf/jbossas.keystore"
           keystorePass="PASSWORD_FOR_KEYSTORE"/>
}}}
  # Now you should be able to access your application through https. Remember to use https:// instead of http:// in your browser-url, or else it will fail.
