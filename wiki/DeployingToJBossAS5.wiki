#summary Provides guidance for running the sample application on JBoss AS 5

= Overview =

JBoss AS 5 is a fully compliant Java EE 5 application server. It was first released to the community in December 2008, post dating the release of the book by several months. This page documents the problems that may be encountered running the sample application on JBoss AS 5 and guidance on how to get the deployment working.

= Persistence unit problems =

If you take the WAR version of the sample application and attempt to deploy it to JBoss AS 5, you likely get the following exception when you attempt to look at a listing page:

{{{
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: org.hibernate.hql.ast.QuerySyntaxException: Facility is not mapped [select facility from Facility facility]
}}}

The problem stems from the fact that JBoss AS 5 handles the deployment of persistence units different than JBoss AS 4. Namely, JBoss AS 5 will load any persistence unit defined in META-INF/persistence.xml automatically. That means when Seam loads the persistence unit, there are now two runtime instances of the persistence unit. Only one is needed. To fix this problem, make the following changes to the project.

  * Instruct the Hibernate JPA provider to bind the runtime persistence unit to JNDI by adding this property to the resources/META-INF/persistence-`*`.xml files
{{{
<property name="jboss.entity.manager.factory.jndi.name" value="java:/open18EntityManagerFactory"/>
}}}
  * Disable the Seam-managed persistence unit in resources/WEB-INF/components.xml
{{{
<persistence:entity-manager-factory name="open18EntityManagerFactory" persistence-unit-name="open18" installed="false"/>
}}}
  * Switch the Seam-managed persistence context to use the persistence unit in JNDI by modifying this component definition in resources/WEB-INF/components.xml
{{{
<persistence:managed-persistence-context name="entityManager" auto-create="true" entity-manager-factory="#{open18EntityManagerFactory}" persistence-unit-jndi-name="java:/open18EntityManagerFactory"/>
}}}

This solution may seem a bit "hackish" because you are resorting to the proprietary JNDI binding that I spoke about in chapter 9. However, this is currently the only option (that I know about) when using JBoss AS 5 that loads exactly one persistence unit and gets Seam to use it.
