This project contains the source code snippets and sample application for the book **Seam in Action**, authored by Dan Allen and published by Manning Publications.

The sample application for Seam in Action is named **Open 18**. The application serves as a golf course directory and golfer community site. For instructions on how to get the application and development environment setup, see the GettingStarted page.

The application is progressively improved and expanded throughout the course of the book. Accordingly, the source code is partitioned in stages such that you can get a snapshot of the application as it stands at the end of each chapter. By following this strategy, it allows you to either work incrementally as you progress through the book or it gives you a convenient starting point if you pickup somewhere in the middle.

The first cut of the application is done using the seam-gen project creation and reverse engineering tool. From there, the application is customized, thus departing from the original sandbox.

The sample application is developed using Seam, JPA/Hibernate, JSF 1.2, Facelets, RichFaces (and ICEfaces), jBPM, Drools, and various other technologies. It is built using both Ant and Maven 2, though the Maven 2 integration comes at the end of the book in the Spring chapter.
