covered in the book.

  - updated using top-down development with MEMBER and GOLFER tables
  - if you want to make the changes to the schema before running the application, execute the following command from the /home/twoputt directory:

java -cp lib/h2.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:file:databases/open18-db/h2 -user open18 -password tiger -script etc/schema/open18-incremental-chaper04.sql
