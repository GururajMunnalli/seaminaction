Seam in Action: Chapter 02
--------------------------
This file details developments made to the application source code during this
chapter. Please note that the enhancements described here my go beyond what is
covered in the book.

open18-db:

  - setup initial schema and import the seed data using the following two commands from the /home/twoputt directory:

java -cp lib/h2.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:file:databases/open18-db/h2 -user open18 -password tiger -script etc/schema/open18-initial-schema.sql
java -cp lib/h2.jar org.h2.tools.RunScript -url jdbc:h2:file:databases/open18-db/h2 -user open18 -password tiger -script etc/schema/open18-seed-data.sql

open18:

  - a WAR seam-gen project for the Open 18 application
  - note that seam-gen.properties in root of project contains the responses used during setup
  - reverse engineered initial schema to create standard seam-gen CRUD application (fields are sorted alphabetically)
    - final reverse engineering configuration can be found here: etc/reveng/open18-seam-gen.reveng.xml
  - customized various entity property names and added supplemental methods using seam-gen.reveng.xml
  - set the default sort order to the name property for both Course and Facility listings
  - add color to the tee sets whereever they are displayed
  - sort the tee sets and holes displayed on the course page (CourseHome)
  - modified the style of messages to make them more attractive (JBSEAM-2033)
  - added RichFaces style customizations (style.xcss) and special overrides for the emeraldTown skin
  - added favicon and the corresponding <link> in layout/template.xhtml
  - prepared project so that it can be deployed to GlassFish
  - remove the description column from listing pages
  - make the uri of facilities on listing page into links

open18ee:

  - an EAR seam-gen project for the Open 18 application
  - same exact modifications as made to the open18 WAR project
  - unfortunately, deployment to GlassFish does *not* work
