Developments made to the application source code in chapter 3.
Please note that the enhancements described here go slightly beyond what is
covered in the book.

open18:

  - add UrlRewriteFilter to build; it is used to parse friendly urls for course and facility; it also eliminated the need for index.html
  - course and facility pages are protected against bogus entity IDs using page actions
  - two example page parameter validators are installed, one for state and one for facility type
  - the reference to the stylesheet in the master template has been fixed to be fully qualified - /#{facesContext.externalContext.requestContextPath}/stylesheet/theme.css
