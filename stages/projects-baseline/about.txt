This directory contains projects that are the raw output of seam-gen. The only
change that is made to the project is that the seam-gen.reveng.xml configuration
is put in place so that when seam generate runs, it creates entity classes that
are consistent with the example source code.

The purpose of this stage is that it allows me to see what has changed in
seam-gen's output so that I can port those changes across the stages. It's
already a lot of work to maintain the stages and this gives me the flexibility
of letting diff to most of that work for me.
