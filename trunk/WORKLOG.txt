TODO:
-----
- missing preloadFacilities in chapter 03
- commit changes to ch03 and carry across code base
- change validator package to validation
- pro status should be in all caps (why not enum?)

- submit JIRA issue for bug in UIAttachment referencing docType
- submit security event bug in Pages.java (then correct the components.xml in the open18 project)
- submit validatorId bug in Param.java
- submit jboss.home in build.properties overriding seam-gen setting bug
- submit JIRA issue about a message regarding multi-module eclipse project in seam-gen creation wizard
- submit JIRA issue that startup attribute is missing from component element in components-2.0.xsd

- write script for generating patches between stages and for an upgrade to Seam

- port changes from chapter 3 to chapter 6
- validate that JBoss AS directory and Seam directory exist before continuing in Ant script
- offer to inflate just the project in projects by name -Dproject=
- continue building out golftips
- there is a problem with hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update with H2 in that it generates duplicate foreign keys
- create a target to auto-generate the prepared databases (open18-db-initial-empty.zip, open18-db-initial-seeded.zip)
- create a target to copy a stage over to the projects/databases workspaces
- an ant target to replace all "/home/twoputt" references with their own root
- support setting stage for build.properties/build.xml

- consider change the eclipse project name to include stage

they need to be sure that JAVA_HOME points to a JDK
they need a way to move projects from staging into the projects area
they may not want to inflate everything (takes up a lot of disk space)
need to limit the number of places I hardcode paths or give them scripts to update them

the schema is messed up in that grass type is not optional
it is allowing duplicate facility names
