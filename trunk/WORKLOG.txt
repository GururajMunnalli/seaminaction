TODO:
-----
- consider change the eclipse project name to include stage
- schema is allowing duplicate facility names (is that okay?)
- add a deploy stage target that will deploy the stage that was inflated (part of quickstart)

- labelClass changed to tabClass in RichFaces 3.2!! (add to migration script)

- make fix-messages-tag.sh an ant target
- capture last login time (good use of events, or perhaps just part of login routine)
- get back to current page after manual login: <h:form style="display: inline;"><h:commandLink action="login" actionListener="#{redirect.captureCurrentView}" value="Login" rendered="#{not identity.loggedIn}"/></h:form>
- links in book are not underlined (change from seam-gen)
- make Facility name a link to Facility uri in subtables
- reorder columns on Facility and Course page so they are logical (propagate across all stages)
- log source code issues in issue tracker
- may want to consider making some cosmetic changes that would need to be propagated across the board
	- ordering of fields on course and facility page
	- application title, navigation page l&f
- add "My Profile" in chapter 11 (after authenticating)
- in chp 03 I use "validator" and "converter" packages and in chapter 06 I introduce a "validation" package (package is never registered in the code, so I could change it)
- should Weather be WeatherType or should GrassType be Grass?
- add access keys across the board
- may want to add to seam-gen:
  <navigation from-action="#{identity.logout}">
    <redirect/>
  </navigation>

- instead of cool new golfers, could do golfers online in last 180 minutes (show idle time, etc)

- reorder fields in forms and reduce number of columns in lists for course and facility (starting a chapter 02?)

- consider using <f:facet><rich:columnGroup></rich:columnGroup></f:facet> for styling listing tables (currently uses subheader)
- want to do cross-validation of password and confirm, but in Ajax4jsf that would cause a problem w/ required fields

- do I necessarily want to restrict selecting conversation if it is the current one?

- submit JIRA issue about a message regarding multi-module eclipse project in seam-gen creation wizard
- submit JIRA issue to configure title/legend for pie chart (totally missing)
- submit JIRA issue to hibernate tools to allow {class-name} to be lowerfirst

- rework seam ref doc to make charting a top level

- perhaps move components.xml to META-INF

- write script for generating patches between stages and for an upgrade to Seam

- there is a problem with hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update with H2 in that it generates duplicate foreign keys (http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-3532)
- create a target to copy a stage over to the projects/databases workspaces
- support setting stage for build.properties/build.xml


they need to be sure that JAVA_HOME points to a JDK
http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Set+JAVA_HOME+variable+in+Windows
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/install/jdk/install-windows.html#Environment
they need a way to move projects from staging into the projects area
they may not want to inflate everything (takes up a lot of disk space)
need to limit the number of places I hardcode paths or give them scripts to update them

the schema is messed up in that grass type is not optional

could use <c:forEach varStatus="n" begin="1" end="9">#{n.index}</c:forEach> for hole counting
