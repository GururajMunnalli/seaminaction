- need to be able to inflate the open18ee EAR project created for chapter 02
- there is a problem with hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update with H2 in that it generates duplicate foreign keys
- create a target to auto-generate the prepared databases (open18-db-initial-empty.zip, open18-db-initial-seeded.zip)
- create a target to copy a stage over to the projects/databases workspaces
- an ant target to replace all "/home/twoputt" references with their own root
