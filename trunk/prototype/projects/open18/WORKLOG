TODO:
----
* complete registration with confirm page and activation page (http://linuxbeans.blogspot.com/2007/09/simple-registration-forms-with-email_23.html)
	* could do active/non-active flag in database
	* could use business process and persist on activation (or the business process flips the switch...I think I like that best; could even set a timeout)

* make conversation required on friend actions (or do we want to allow it not, and have /profile.xhtml pull up self if golferId not set?)
* change scope of round result to use conversation scoped (or page scoped) factory result set only (rather than roundList itself)
* search is broken for rounds (need to have *Example roles put back in place)
* cleanup trivia JavaScript (currently in simplehome.xhtml)
* cleanup add to favorites JavaScript
* courier action doesn't add any JSF messages (would be nice after sending)
* add a page or control for admin to set agent for course
* use hasPermission in UI to prevent Edit button from showing for private courses, etc.
* perhaps make #{profileAction.self}
* should we make profile.seam?golferId=3 just profile.seam?id=3
* could use nested conversation to navigate between friends (see swf-phonebook-clone)
* be able to edit one's own profile
* need to better organize packages

* course wizard doesn't save (this happened because grass type was required)

* might want to create scoresForRound factory to prevent hammering of roundHome.scores

* can use @Size restrictions on collections (getHoles(), getTees())

* need to remove member from being an agent before deleting (and reverse friend relationship)

* would like to change auth package to security, but I need a new XML namespace prefix (sec?)

* put login box on homepage

* make formating consistent (tabs or spaces)
