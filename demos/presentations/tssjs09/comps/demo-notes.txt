- entity class names for identity management don't have to be named User and Role
	- in this case MemberAccount and MemberRole
- two companies, a design firm and a client
- each member is associated with a company + one super admin
- rules give members and to their stuff; employees access to companies stuff and clients; admin global access
	- show how rule set is fed into Seam

- show how a rule allows a user in admin role to manage identities
	<restrict> on /view/useradmin/usermanager.page.xml

- member can upload design and view own design (independent of ACL)
	<restrict> on /view/design.page.xml

- grant access to design to single member, verify they can see it but no one else
- grant access to the member role, verify that all members can see it, but not guests
- grant access to client, verify that employees of that company can see it

- show how the list of designs is filtered
- show how the permissions are assigned
- show how available actions for target type are defined using annotations
- show how permissions are granted, both when uploading and assigning permission to design

- go down list of rules in resources/security.drl
