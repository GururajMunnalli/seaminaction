# Overview #

I strongly recommend using a Java EE application server to execute Seam applications. Java EE server's provide the complete stack of core libraries and services that you need to develop enterprise applications.

However, if you must use Tomcat, I have provided instructions for how to modify the project so that it can be deployed to tomcat. Please see the article [Running a seam-gen project on Apache Tomcat without Embedded JBoss](http://seamframework.org/Documentation/RunningASeamgenProjectOnApacheTomcatWithoutEmbeddedJBoss) on the Seam wiki.
